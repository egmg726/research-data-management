- Explain the meaning of each FAIR principle and give practical examples.
- Identify changes you can make to data and metadata to increase FAIRness.
- Recognise repository and policy requirements that support FAIR data.

## FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)

FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) are guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship. The acronym highlights characteristics that make data more useful to humans and machines.

- Findable: Assign persistent identifiers (for example DOIs), provide rich metadata, and ensure metadata is indexed by searchable resources. Use clear and consistent naming and include keywords and controlled terms where possible.
- Accessible: Make data retrievable using standard protocols (e.g. HTTP(S), API access) and document access conditions. Accessibility does not necessarily mean open — it can include well-documented access restrictions.
- Interoperable: Use shared formats, standards and vocabularies so datasets can be combined and analysed together. This includes adopting community ontologies and common file formats (for example CSV, JSON, NetCDF).
- Reusable: Provide clear licences, provenance, and richly described metadata so others can reproduce and build on the work. Include methods, code, and versioned data where possible.

Practical drivers for FAIR:

- Funding agencies increasingly require data management or data sharing plans that align with FAIR principles.
- Many journals require data underlying publications to be available and well-documented.
- FAIR practices increase the longevity and impact of research outputs.

Examples:

- Add an explicit licence (e.g. CC BY) and a DOI when depositing data in a recognised repository.
- Use ISO dates and unit annotations in metadata for clarity.
- Adopt community vocabularies or ontologies for key fields (e.g. species, disease terms).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- FAIR is about enabling discovery and reuse by humans and machines, not necessarily about being open.
- Persistent identifiers, standard protocols, and rich metadata are central to FAIR.
- Interoperability is achieved by adopting community standards and controlled vocabularies.
- Reuse requires clear licence and provenance information.
- Start embedding FAIR principles in your workflow from the project outset.

## Introduction

Research data management (RDM) is central to modern research. Increasingly complex data sets and collaborative projects have meant that the ability to organise, store, and share data responsibly is essential for ensuring research integrity, reproducibility, and compliance with institutional and funding requirements. Poor data management can lead to wasted time, duplicated effort, and a lack of reproducibility.

This workshop, **Research Data Management and Analysis Practicalities**, is designed to provide practical guidance on implementing good RDM practices early in your research workflow. We will explore strategies for organising files and folders, naming conventions, metadata standards, and principles of tidy data. Additionally, we will discuss computational considerations, including where to run analyses, how to store and transfer data securely, and options for large-scale computing.

By the end of this session, you will understand:

- Why RDM matters for transparency, reproducibility, and open science.
- How to structure and document your data for long-term usability.
- Best practices for file naming, metadata, and data cleaning.
- Available tools and resources for storage, computation, and sharing.

Whether you are starting a new project or revisiting existing analyses, adopting these practices will help you avoid common pitfalls and streamline your research process.

## Have you ever…

- received data that were difficult to work with?
- tried unsuccessfully to replicate an analysis?
- been frustrated by a lack of transparency from collaborators?
- been confused revisiting one of your own analyses?

If you answered "yes" to any of these, the techniques in this workshop will help address the underlying causes and give you practical ways to prevent similar problems in future projects.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Start RDM planning at project inception; retrofitting is costly and error-prone.
- Clear, consistent file naming and folder structures save time and prevent mistakes.
- Metadata is essential: it makes data findable, understandable and reusable.
- Reproducibility requires both well-organised data and documented analysis steps.
- Use institutional and community resources for storage, sharing and preservation.
